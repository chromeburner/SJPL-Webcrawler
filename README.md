# SJPL-Webcrawler
A webcrawler for SJPL's events page
The webcrawler works by pulling data from SJPL's events pages. Under the variable "url", paste in the events page from SJPL's events page. After that, run the code and it will
a listing of the events and dates. You'll need to do some cleaning from here, but it's not too hard.
